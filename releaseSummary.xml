<overview>

<p>
The most up to date information about Derby releases can be found on the
<a href="https://db.apache.org/derby/derby_downloads.html">Derby download page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Apache Derby is a pure Java relational database engine using standard SQL and
JDBC as its APIs. More information about Derby can be found on the
<a href="https://db.apache.org/derby/">Apache web site</a>.
Derby functionality includes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Embedded engine with JDBC drivers</li>
<li>Network Server</li>
<li>Network client JDBC drivers</li>
<li>Command line tools: ij (SQL scripting), dblook (schema dump) and sysinfo (system info)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The 10.16 release family supports the following Java and JDBC versions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java SE 17 and higher with JDBC 4.2.</li>
</ul>
</overview>

<newFeatures>

<p>
This is a feature release. The following significant change has been made:
</p>

<ul>

<li><b>SecurityManager deprecated</b> - Derby no longer supports the Java SecurityManager. This is because the Open JDK team deprecated the SecurityManager and marked it for removal. This deprecation happened under the aegis of
<a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/411">JEP 411</a>.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
New users should consult the
<a href="https://db.apache.org/derby/manuals/index.html#docs_10.16">10.16 documentation</a>,
especially the
<a href="https://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.16/getstart/index.html">Getting Started With Derby</a> guide.
</p>

<p>
Existing users who want to run Derby with a SecurityManager must NOT upgrade to version 10.16.
Instead, those users must continue to use older versions of Derby. Please see the
<a href="https://db.apache.org/derby/derby_downloads.html">Derby download page</a>
in order to understand how Derby and Java versions correspond.

    These are the instructions for verifying the signed distributions. Probably you
    won't need to touch this section.
    
-->

<releaseVerification>

<p>It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded
files using the PGP and SHA-512 signatures.  SHA-512 verification ensures the
file was not corrupted during the download process.  PGP verification
ensures that the file came from a certain person.</p>

<p>The PGP signatures can be verified using
<a href="https://www.pgpi.org/">PGP</a> or
<a href="https://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a>.
First download the Apache Derby
<a href="https://www.apache.org/dist/db/derby/KEYS">KEYS</a>
as well as the <code>asc</code> signature file for the particular
distribution. It is important that you get these files from the ultimate
trusted source - the main ASF distribution site, rather than from a mirror.
Then verify the signatures using ...</p>

<pre>
% pgpk -a KEYS
% pgpv db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% pgp -ka KEYS
% pgp db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

</pre>

<p>To verify the SHA-512 checksums on the files, you need to use a
platform-specific program. On Mac OSX, this program is called
<code>shasum</code>, on Linux it is called <code>sha512sum</code>,
and on Windows it is called <code>CertUtil</code>.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you verify your downloads with both PGP and SHA-512.</p>
